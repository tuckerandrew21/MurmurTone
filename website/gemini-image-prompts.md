# Gemini Image Prompts for Features Page

Final approved prompts for the three scenario-based illustrations on the MurmurTone features page.

## Box 1: Local Processing - "Your Space, Your Words"

```
A warm, approachable illustration in a modern editorial style showing a home office workspace from a slightly elevated angle. A person sits at a wooden desk, hands typing on a laptop. The person is speaking naturally (show subtle, simple sound wave lines flowing from their mouth toward the laptop), and the laptop screen displays real-time transcription text appearing as clean lines of text - the screen should have a subtle teal tint (#0d9488) showing active processing. Small teal sparkles or subtle dots (#0d9488) appear around the laptop screen suggesting AI processing happening right there locally. NO boundary circle, NO glow around the workspace - just the natural scene showing everything contained within the desk area. The environment includes natural warm sunlight creating soft shadows through a window, a wooden desk with rich honey grain texture, a terracotta pot with succulent plant, steaming white coffee mug, neutral beige walls with simple framed abstract art, and a small notepad with pen. The person appears comfortable, relaxed, and focused - showing someone naturally using the tool in their personal space. Color palette: warm honey woods, soft creams and beiges dominate, with small vibrant teal accents only for the processing indicators on the laptop screen. Clean modern editorial magazine illustration style - friendly, human-centered, inviting, similar to the aesthetic of the cloud-blocking illustration. The visual story is: you speak, it processes right here on your laptop, everything stays local and self-contained on your desk. NO external elements, NO cloud servers, NO heavy borders or circles. Mood is comfortable, secure, and personal. IMPORTANT: 16:9 horizontal rectangular format, NOT square or circular - wide landscape orientation.

## Box 2: Cloud Blocked - "No Prying Eyes"

```
A warm, approachable illustration in a modern editorial style showing a home office workspace. A laptop sits on a wooden desk in the foreground displaying a document with visible text lines. A pair of hands are visible typing on the laptop keyboard, adding human connection to the scene. CRITICAL: From the laptop screen at the BOTTOM, a THICK dotted arrow line (not thin - make it clearly visible) originates and travels UPWARD toward a flat shield icon positioned ABOVE the laptop. The arrow originates at the laptop, points UP, and terminates at the shield where it is blocked. At the exact point where the upward-traveling arrow meets the shield, show a bold red X to emphasize the complete block. The arrow does NOT continue past the shield. The shield in teal (#0d9488) with a simple lock symbol must be COMPLETELY FLAT with NO gradients, NO shading, NO depth - solid teal fill like a logo or flat icon. Think minimalist graphic design, not 3D or rendered. ABOVE and BEYOND the shield in the distant background through the window, show ONE consolidated cluster of cloud server icons (2-3 clouds with small server racks inside grouped together) appearing faded and distant in soft gray-blue tones, with X marks. Keep the clouds grouped together in one area, not scattered. These clouds should be clearly separated from and beyond the shield, never reached by the arrow. The data flow direction is: laptop with hands (bottom) → thick dotted arrow points up → completely flat shield blocks (middle) → rejected cloud cluster (top/distant background). The workspace includes natural warm sunlight creating soft shadows through a large window, a wooden desk with rich honey grain texture, a terracotta pot with a small succulent plant, a steaming white coffee mug, and neutral beige walls with simple framed abstract art. Color palette: warm honey woods and creams dominate the foreground, bold FLAT solid teal shield as the hero element (midground), soft desaturated blue-grays for the rejected cloud cluster (background). Clean modern editorial magazine illustration style - friendly and inviting, NOT technical diagrams or 3D renders. Mood is protective and reassuring like a safe, cozy home. 16:9 horizontal format.
```

**Note:** We actually ended up preferring the simplified version WITHOUT arrows. Here's the final approved version:

```
A warm, approachable illustration in a modern editorial style showing a home office workspace from a slightly elevated angle. A person's hands are visible typing on a laptop at a wooden desk. The laptop screen displays a document with visible text lines. The immediate workspace (laptop, hands, desk area) has a gentle teal glow or soft boundary outline in teal (#0d9488) surrounding it, emphasizing "your protected personal space" - subtle and warm, not heavy or technical. A flat, graphic shield icon in solid teal (NO gradients, NO 3D depth - completely flat like a logo) sits prominently on or near the desk, symbolically protecting the workspace. Through a large window in the background, far away and clearly separated from the workspace, show a cluster of cloud server icons (clouds with server racks inside) that are heavily faded, desaturated in cold gray-blue tones, and marked with red X symbols. These clouds should feel distant and unreachable, in stark contrast to the warm, vibrant foreground. NO ARROWS - the story is told through spatial relationship: warm/bright/protected workspace in front vs cold/faded/rejected clouds far away. The environment includes natural warm sunlight creating soft shadows, a wooden desk with rich honey grain texture, a terracotta pot with succulent plant, steaming white coffee mug, neutral beige walls with simple framed abstract art, and a small notepad with pen. Color palette creates clear hierarchy: warm honey woods, creams, and vibrant teal dominate the close/protected foreground, while cold desaturated grays exist only in the distant rejected background. Clean modern editorial magazine illustration style - friendly, inviting, human-centered. The visual story is: your work stays here in your warm, protected space; cloud servers are distant, faded, and rejected. Mood is secure, cozy, and reassuring. 16:9 horizontal format.
```

**Status:** ✅ Approved (simplified version without arrows)

## Box 3: Offline Working - "Always There When You Need It"

```
A warm, approachable illustration in a modern editorial style showing a home office or cozy café workspace. The camera angle is positioned so we can clearly see the laptop screen - the laptop should be angled toward the viewer with the screen visible and readable. A man sits at a wooden desk, hands typing on a laptop, appearing unbothered and focused. The laptop is positioned so both the man and the viewer can see the screen interface clearly - NOT showing the back of the laptop. In the upper corner of the image, show a simple WiFi icon with a bold red diagonal slash indicating no internet connection. CRITICAL: The laptop screen must clearly show an interface view like a desktop or app launcher with all icons displayed ON the screen surface, visible to the camera, not floating in 3D space.

CRITICAL DISTINCTION - TWO TYPES OF ICONS ON SCREEN:
1. DISABLED APPS (7-8 icons): Generic app icons for email, browser, cloud storage, video chat, etc. These must be EXTREMELY faded - almost ghost-like, barely visible, heavily washed out with very low opacity (around 15-20%), so desaturated they're almost invisible against the white/light screen background.

2. MURMURTONE APP (1 icon): A simple teal shield icon in vibrant teal #0d9488. This icon must be rendered at FULL COLOR, FULL BRIGHTNESS, FULL SATURATION, 100% opacity - NOT faded, NOT grayed out, NOT desaturated. This should be the most visually prominent and eye-catching element on the entire laptop screen, positioned in the center or prominent location.

The contrast between the ghost-like disabled apps and the vivid bright teal MurmurTone shield icon should be extreme and immediately obvious. A small clean badge displaying "Still Working" appears near the bright MurmurTone shield icon on the screen. All icons must be flat on the screen surface as interface elements.

The environment has warm, natural lighting from a window creating soft shadows, wooden desk with honey grain texture, terracotta pot with succulent plant, steaming coffee mug, neutral beige walls, and simple framed abstract art. The man's body language and facial expression convey calm confidence - relaxed posture, not stressed about the outage. View the scene from an angle that shows the man from the side or three-quarter view, with the laptop screen clearly visible and facing toward the camera/viewer. Color palette creates EXTREME dramatic contrast: warm woods and creams throughout the environment, BARELY VISIBLE ghost-like grays for the disabled app icons on screen, and VIBRANT BOLD teal #0d9488 for the working MurmurTone shield icon. Clean modern editorial magazine illustration style - reassuring, friendly, human-centered, matching the aesthetic of Box 1 and Box 2. The visual story: internet is down (WiFi slash), most apps are nearly invisible/disappeared (ghost-like on screen), but MurmurTone shield icon stands out brilliantly in vivid teal and stays functional. NO floating elements, NO 3D app icons around laptop, NO arrows. Mood is calm, dependable, and reassuring. 16:9 horizontal format.
