| "comma" | , |
| "question mark" | ? |
| "exclamation mark" | ! |

### AI Text Cleanup (Ollama) 🌟 Killer Feature

**The only offline voice typing tool with AI-powered text cleanup.**

Transform casual speech into polished text automatically—all processing stays 100% local. No other voice typing tool (Wispr Flow, Voicy, SuperWhisper) offers AI text improvement without cloud APIs.

#### Quick Start

1. **Install Ollama** from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com) (free, open-source)
2. **Download a model**: `ollama pull llama3.2:3b` (~2GB, one-time)
3. **Enable in Settings** → AI Text Cleanup
4. **Configure your preferences**:
   - **Mode**: Grammar only, Formality only, or Both
   - **Formality Level**: Casual, Professional, or Formal
5. **Start transcribing** - AI cleanup happens automatically

#### What It Does

**Grammar Mode** - Fixes spelling, grammar, and punctuation while preserving your voice:

```text
Input:  "hey can u help me with this thing i dunno how to do it"
Output: "Hey, can you help me with this thing? I don't know how to do it."
```

**Formality Mode** - Adjusts tone for your audience:

```text
Input:  "hey boss can we chat about that project thing?"
Output: "I would like to schedule a meeting to discuss the current status of our project."
```

**Combined Mode** - Grammar + Formality in one pass:

```text
Input:  "yo i aint sure bout this approach"
Output: "I am uncertain about the appropriateness of this approach."
```

#### Performance

- **Average Response**: 2.4 seconds
- **Quality**: Excellent (see [test report](OLLAMA_INTEGRATION_TEST_REPORT.md))
- **Privacy**: 100% offline, zero cloud API calls
- **Cost**: Free (uses your local hardware)

#### Why This Matters

**Privacy-First AI**: Unlike competitors that send your transcriptions to OpenAI, Claude, or other cloud services, MurmurTone keeps everything on your machine. Perfect for:

- Healthcare professionals (HIPAA compliance)
- Legal professionals (attorney-client privilege)
- Enterprise users (data security policies)
- Privacy advocates (no tracking, no telemetry)

**Recommended Model**: `llama3.2:3b` (fast, accurate, 2GB). Advanced users can try `llama3.1:8b` for higher quality.

### Translation Mode

1. **Open Settings** → Translation Mode
2. **Enable translation** and select source language (or auto-detect)
3. **Speak in any language**, output English
4. Works with 18+ languages

### Audio File Transcription

1. **Right-click tray icon** → Transcribe Audio File
2. **Select MP3, WAV, or M4A file**
3. **Transcription saves to text file** (opens automatically)
